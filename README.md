Finding Maximum in a Circularly Shifted Array
Overview
This project implements and analyzes an O(log n) algorithm to find the maximum element in a sorted array that has been circularly (rotated) shifted.
The algorithm is a variation of binary search, which efficiently locates the pivot point — the position where the order “wraps around.” The element just before this pivot is the maximum value in the array.
